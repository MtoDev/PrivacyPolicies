## Decision Maker - Privacy Policy
**Last updated**: April 28, 2025

**Decision Maker** (“we”, “us” or “our”) operates the Decision Maker mobile application (the “App”).
This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your data.

### 1. Information We Collect
**Personal Data**

  - The App does not collect any personal data (e.g., name, email, phone number).

  - All option entries and selections you make are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted or shared.

**Usage Data**

  - We do not collect analytics or usage statistics. The App does not connect to any servers or third-party analytics services.

### 2. Use of Your Information
Since the App collects no data, we do not use, process, or share any personal information. All decision-making logic runs entirely on your device.

### 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
  - No third-party sharing. We do not share any data with third parties, advertisers, or analytics providers.

  - No advertising. The App contains no ads or in-app promotions.

### 4. Permissions
The App requests no special permissions beyond the defaults required to run on Android. You will not be prompted for access to contacts, location, camera, storage, etc.

### 5. Data Security
Your decision options and selections are stored only in the App’s private storage on your device. We employ standard industry measures to ensure the App’s code runs securely, but since no data is transmitted or stored on servers, there is no risk of external data exposure.

### 6. Children’s Privacy
The App does not collect any personal information from children under 13. If you believe your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can delete it.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

### 8. Your Rights
Because we do not collect or store your personal data, there is no personal information to access, correct, or delete. However, you can always uninstall the App to remove all local data.
